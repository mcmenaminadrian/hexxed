Hexxed is a hex editor, written in Groovy and licensed under the GNU GPL (v3).

It is free software and you may distribute and modify it under the GPL's terms.

Hexxed has a Vi-like interface. You can also use it to specify block sizes
and to view data in 8, 16, 32 or 64 bit formats. It will display character
data in 8 or 16 bit (Unicode) formats and you may also choose to regard the
data as little or big endian.

It is a work in progress.
